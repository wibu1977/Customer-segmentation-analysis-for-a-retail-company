Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis for a Retail Company

In today’s competitive retail landscape, understanding customer behavior is essential for devising effective marketing strategies. Our latest project involves segmenting customers using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to gain insights and tailor marketing efforts for a retail company. Here’s a comprehensive overview of the project and its findings.

Objective

The primary goal of this project was to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM analysis. By categorizing customers into different groups, the retail company can develop targeted marketing strategies to enhance customer engagement, increase sales, and improve overall customer retention.

Dataset Overview

The analysis was conducted using a dataset spanning transactions from 2009 to 2011. The dataset included the following columns:

InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction.
StockCode: Product code.
Description: Product name.
Quantity: Number of products purchased.
InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction.
UnitPrice: Price per product unit.
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Country: Customer’s country.

Data Cleaning and Preparation

During the initial exploration, some data irregularities were identified, such as negative values for quantity and price, which indicated returns or cancellations. These issues were addressed through data cleaning processes, including:

Handling Missing Values: Dropping records with missing customer IDs.

Filtering Negative Values: Separating sales from returns to accurately reflect net sales.

Outlier Removal: Using interquartile range (IQR) to identify and remove outliers in monetary value and frequency.

RFM Analysis Explained

RFM analysis categorizes customers based on:

Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase.
Frequency (F): How often a customer makes a purchase.
Monetary Value (M): How much money a customer spends.
By scoring customers on these three metrics, we can group them into meaningful segments.

Clustering and Customer Segmentation
We employed clustering techniques, specifically K-Means, to categorize customers into distinct segments. Through testing various cluster numbers, four optimal clusters were identified, each representing different customer behaviors:

VIP Shoppers

High monetary value, high frequency, and low recency.
These customers are highly valuable and engage frequently. They’ve made recent purchases, suggesting high loyalty.
Strategy: Offer exclusive rewards, early access to sales, and personalized experiences to maintain their loyalty.
Lapsed Big Spenders

Low monetary value, low frequency, and high recency.
These customers haven’t purchased recently, making them at risk of churning.
Strategy: Implement win-back campaigns with personalized offers to re-engage them.
Regular Midrange Customers

Medium monetary value, medium frequency, and medium-low recency.
Consistent buyers who show potential for upselling or cross-selling.
Strategy: Introduce bundled offers and a mid-tier loyalty program to encourage more frequent purchases.
New or Occasional Buyers

Low monetary value, low frequency, and medium recency.
These customers may be new or purchase infrequently.
Strategy: Provide incentives like first-time discounts or free shipping to boost repeat purchases.
Insights and Recommendations
The segmentation provided actionable insights to the retail company:

Enhanced Targeting: Each customer segment can be approached with tailored marketing campaigns, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.
Retention Strategies: By identifying at-risk customers, the company can proactively engage with them to prevent churn.
Optimized Inventory: Understanding customer preferences helps in planning inventory based on high-demand products.

Conclusion

RFM analysis proved to be an effective tool for understanding customer behavior in the retail space. By segmenting customers into well-defined clusters, the company can implement strategies that cater to the unique needs of each group, ultimately driving growth and improving customer satisfaction.
